# Bank Statement Analysis App

## Overview

This Streamlit application enables users to upload their bank statements in PDF format and receive a comprehensive analysis of their transactions. The app extracts transaction data from the uploaded statement, categorizes the expenses, computes key financial metrics, and determines loan eligibility using a pre-trained Random Forest model. Additionally, it provides visualizations to help users understand their spending habits.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Users can easily upload their bank statements in PDF format.
- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text from the uploaded PDF.
- **Transaction Processing**: Identifies and processes transaction details including date, description, amount, and balance.
- **Expense Categorization**: Categorizes transactions into predefined categories like Credits, Payments, Bank Charges, etc.
- **Key Metrics Calculation**: Computes average daily expense, total expense, maximum expense, minimum expense, and the number of transactions.
- **Loan Eligibility Prediction**: Uses a Random Forest model to predict loan eligibility based on transaction history.
- **Visualizations**: Provides bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to visualize expense distribution and trends.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Upload**
   - Users upload their bank statement in PDF format using the file uploader interface.

2. **PDF Parsing**
   - The app extracts text from the PDF document using the `pdfplumber` library.

3. **Transaction Processing**
   - Extracted text is processed to identify individual transactions, capturing details such as date, description, amount, and balance.

4. **Expense Categorization**
   - Transactions are categorized based on their descriptions into predefined categories like Payments, Credits, Bank Charges, etc.

5. **Key Metrics Calculation**
   - The app calculates various financial metrics including average daily expense, total expense, maximum and minimum expense, and the number of transactions.

6. **Loan Eligibility Prediction**
   - A Random Forest model is used to predict loan eligibility based on features extracted from transaction data.

7. **Visualizations**
   - The app generates visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to represent expense distribution and trends.

8. **Hiding Streamlit Components**
   - Customizes the UI by hiding default Streamlit components like the menu and footer for a cleaner look.
